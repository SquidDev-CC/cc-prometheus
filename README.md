# CC Prometheus

A Minecraft mod that exposes ComputerCraft data as a prometheus exporter. The default port is 8189.

## Setup
Just chuck the jar into your mods folder. Make sure that the name of the exporter mod is alphabetically after the CC:T 
jar, otherwise some features may not be available (because of the order classes or loaded, I can't control this in the
mod its self.)  

Note that configs are currently not supported; those are coming soon.
